# Get Decked!
Silly and fun, open-sourced card game about putting on equipment and fighting.

## Description
This game is intended to be fun, silly and fantastic. There is no rule that can't be broken. Cards will take precedence over the core system rules, and when all else fails, as long as all players agree on an outcome, that's the outcome that happens.

The basic idea is that each player will have two decks: one for wearing things and one for fighting things. Each deck can be any size, but should be no less than 30 cards each and should be able to be shuffled in a reasonable manner/time before playing. (If you're feeling chaotic, go ahead and shuffle the decks together and play with one deck, just don't get mad when you draw 5 pairs of pants in a row when you want to attack.)

Choose a species to play as and build a deck around that species, perhaps themeing it around a certain type of character class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, etc.). Species will differ in how they don their armor and weapons, such as requiring a different total number of items, multiple items of the same type, or some slots completely empty. In general, most classes start with the same basic setup of equipment slots, but they might be modified in some ways.

## How to play

Each player has 20 life points and two decks: one for equipment and one for fighting/interacting with opponents. Each turn, fill your hand up to 5 cards by drawing from either deck (do not draw unless you have < 5 cards in hand). During your turn you can equip gear or play attack cards in any order (but the order may be specified on the cards for certain interactions). Your turn is finished when you have no more cards to play or interact with on the board, or when you choose not to play any more cards (pass the turn). Some cards may be played during another player's turn, denoted by a certain symbol or keyword (usually this will only be attack cards and not equipment cards).

You cannot defeat another player until you are wearing a full set of equipment. Any effect of yours that would kill another player is nullified until you are wearing a full set of equipment. However, players at anytime are able to defeat themselves. Any self-imposed effect that can harm your player does so, including effects that would cause you to be defeated or lose the game.

 ## Optional Chaos Deck
 There is an optional deck to play with that makes the game more fun/chaotic/random. It has very powerful effects that can affect one or more players, turning the favor randomly. Can be a physically printed deck or just a QR code that is scanned for a chaos effect.
